# Luna Edge technical interview
## Basic commands
- Run app: <code>yarn vite</code>

## Summary
Imagine that you are a Pokémon trainer where you have to fill out a form with your name and last name and then select your team of 4 Pokémon to fight in the Battle Tower. The task is to create this form with inputs, button and a **select component** to select these 4 Pokémon and also show the sprites of your chosen Pokémon in a modal.

## Luna Edge projects are built with:
- React
- typescript

- tailwindcss
- storybook
- React hook form

## Information
- Do request with Axios to this API to extract the necessary Pokemon data: https://pokeapi.co/
